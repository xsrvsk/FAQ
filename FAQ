FAQ
1. Who are you and why should I trust you with my skins?
- I am a young (2002) student from Poland that got into skins around 10 years ago. Since then my passion to them only grew. I am relatively small trader that mainly focuses on small polish community. I started my trading journey with around 25-50$ budget per month and built my way up to where I am today - around $15.000 at peak. I also have IT degree but I won't call myself an IT guy. I am studying Management and Sociology in Businness and Media @ Koźmiński University.
2. What payment methods do you support?
- As I am mostly focused around my small polish community most often I use: Bank transfer and BLIK. I do accept PayPal and Crypto but rarely.
